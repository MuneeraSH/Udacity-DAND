# Udacity-DAND
Here you can find the projects i have done when taking Data Analysis course by Udacity in contribution with Misk Academy.
The projects are: 
1. Invesitagating Dataset of "No show Appointments"; This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
2. A/B Testing: For this project, I worked and understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. the goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
3. Data Wrangling: In this project I wrangled and visualized/analyzed the tweet archive of @dog_rates, 
also known as WeRateDogs. We can get helpful and useful insights based on the 
information of archive tweets, that is done through different steps starting with 
gathering and extracting data ending up with the analysis and visualization.
4. Preliminary Data wrangling of "Ford GoBike" dataset; This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in 2018. The purpose is to investigate which variable(s) has the most effect on trip duration of the users.
